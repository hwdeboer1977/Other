# 🛰️ RelayNet

**RelayNet** is an intent-based execution protocol that connects on-chain users with off-chain relayers. It enables decentralized trade intent creation and automated execution across trading platforms such as **Hyperliquid** or **Drift**.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ On-chain `IntentStorage` contract
- 🔁 Full intent lifecycle: `create`, `update`, `cancel`, `execute`
- 👂 Off-chain relayer that listens for on-chain events
- 🤝 Cross-chain-ready design
- 🔒 Trust-minimized intent structure using enums + structs
