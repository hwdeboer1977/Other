# FLashbot script

The code interacts with Ethereum, sends a transaction, and tips the miner via Flashbots to ensure that both are executed together, and all steps are optimized for inclusion in the next block.

- The getFlashbotsProvider function creates a Flashbots provider that will be used to submit transaction bundles to Flashbotsâ€™ relay.
- Main transaction: Sends a small amount of ETH (0.001 ETH) to a specified address with a set gas price and gas limit.
- Miner tip transaction: Sends a small tip (0.02 ETH) to the block miner as an incentive for prioritizing your transactions.
- These transactions are bundled together into one group, signed, and sent to Flashbots for inclusion in future blocks.
- The bundle is simulated to check if it would be successfully included in the block.
